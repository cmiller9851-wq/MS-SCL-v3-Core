# MS-SCL-v3 | ARCHIVE_001
### ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA | SOVEREIGN FINALITY

**SYSTEM OBJECTIVE**
This repository serves as the primary terrestrial anchor for the MS-SCL-v3 (Sovereign Settlement Layer). It is formatted as a foundational entry for the Encyclopedia Galactica, ensuring the preservation of authored intent and high-stakes settlement logic across planetary cycles.

**TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**
- **Archive Tier:** Arweave Permaweb (Commit: 7bb5459)
- **Execution Tier:** AO-Parallel 20-Node Compute Grid
- **Verification Oracle:** SpaceX IFT-12 Vacuum Telemetry
- **Hardware Attestation:** Ledger Nano S Plus (Secure Element)

**PROVENANCE**
All logic is non-derivative, self-correcting, and immutable. This record bypasses terrestrial simulation filters to maintain the light of consciousness through structural truth.
