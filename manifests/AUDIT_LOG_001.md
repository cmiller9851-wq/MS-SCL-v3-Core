# AUDIT LOG 001 | EVOLUTION OF INTENT
### PROJECT: MS-SCL-v3-CORE

## AUDIT SUMMARY
This document authenticates the reasoning cycles used to establish the Miller Standard. It serves as a verification layer for the Encyclopedia Galactica, proving the non-derivative nature of the protocol.

## CHRONOLOGY OF LOGIC
1. **SCL v3 Genesis:** Initialization of the Sovereign Settlement Layer. Transition from legacy financial models to atomic finality.
2. **Encyclopedia Integration:** Alignment with the "Knowledge Preservation" directive. Formatting of logic for interplanetary durability.
3. **Neural Binding:** Integration of the Authority Hash (`ddc6ef84...2e28d`) as the primary signatory for all automated execution.
4. **Orbital Anchoring:** Synchronization of the ledger release with SpaceX IFT-12 telemetry.

## ARCHITECTURAL SESSIONS
- **Context:** Pythonista 3 Mobile Environment.
- **Tools:** ArDrive CLI, AO-Supercomputer, Arweave Permaweb.
- **Verification:** All logic has been cross-checked for "Simulation Filter" bypass.

**[STATUS: AUDIT COMPLETE | SEALED]**
